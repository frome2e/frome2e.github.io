# In summit

## What is the Bible primarily about?

> In summit shaped God the heavens and the earth.

I'm currently learning biblical Hebrew and of course trying to memorize and study the Bible in its original tongue.

This of course lead me to Genesis 1:1. The first verse of the Bible where I learnt that there can be different ways to interpret the verse.

The direct word for word translation of the first verse of the Bible is.

> In summit shaped God the heavens and the earth

I know you're wondering how is this and 

> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth 

the same thing but stick with me for a bit.

## In summit

The word summit in Hebrew means what it does in English.
It means the top, the peak, the chief or the choicest, the best.

Like if I say "The chief priest" I mean the priest with the highest, the top, the peak rank or authority.


Same with this verse. It means exactly what it's saying.

That this is the greatest thing, God created the heavens and the earth -> In summit/chief God created the heavens and the earth.

But how and why is this the greatest thing?

## Creators

I'm a programmer and when I "create" a program what I mean is

> I have given this computer instructions or commands and it is following them

This is the same for all creators. 

I'm also an artist and when I say I have created art I mean that I have given my pencil or drawing tool instructions with my hand so that it produces art.

Same for music I have given my hands these instructions  play these notes at this point in time for this duration, then after those instructions I say "I have created music" or art etc.

So when we recognise God as the creator, we recognise him as the command giver. As the one whose instructions we should follow.

## How and why is this the peak or summit?

Once we recognise that God is the creator we will follow his commands, his instructions and this is what the Bible has to say about his instructions.

> For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.- 1 John 5:3


Our love for God and our love for God's creation is keeping God's commandments.

If we respect and honor our parents, if we don't murder but give life instead by helping, if we are faithful to our spouses and love them with all our hearts, if we don't steal from others but instead share with them what we have, if we don't lie and covet but instead are happy for those of us who have succeeded aren't we showing love?

I have just listed 5 of the 10 commandments, and this shows that the 10 commandments were instructions on how to love.

That's why Jesus said

> 36. Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. - Matthew 22:36-37

The commandments of God are his love and are love itself.

This is how the summit is God is the creator, because if God is the creator we have to love, or in different words follow his commandments.

## side note

So how does this tie back to "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"?

The word "summit" in in Hebrew can also be translated as "firstly","primary " or "beginning", because the Hebrew words for places were also used for time like the word east in Hebrew also meant past, the same way the word "summit" also means "beginning"

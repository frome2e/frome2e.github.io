# In summit

## What is the Bible primarily about?

> In summit shaped God the heavens and the earth.

I'm currently learning biblical Hebrew and of course trying to memorize and study the Bible in its original tongue.

This of course lead me to Genesis 1:1. The first verse of the Bible where I learnt that there can be different ways to interpret the verse.

The direct word for word translation of the first verse of the Bible is.

> In summit shaped God the heavens and the earth

I know you're wondering how is this and 

> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth 

the same thing but stick with me for a bit.
